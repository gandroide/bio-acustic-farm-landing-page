    "title": "A silent problem impacting your profitability",
    "description": "Neonatal crushing mortality in swine maternity houses represents up to 8% losses per litter. Late detection of acoustic stress signals — such as crushing screams and persistent coughing — delays intervention and multiplies losses. Traditional camera-based methods compromise biosecurity and require expensive network infrastructure."
